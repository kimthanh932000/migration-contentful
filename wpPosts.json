      "content": "\n<p>Whether you’re writing a blog post for your own blog or contributing a guest post if there’s one element that often gets neglected, it is the author bio.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Are people even looking at it?” you might wonder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The answer is —</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/4T3QPfXhVHrlvekSbf/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>7 Best Practices to Write a Short Author Bio</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Believe it or not: your author bio does not go unnoticed. It’s one of the things people look at before or after reading your content.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only does it give you the opportunity to introduce readers to what you do but it’s a good space to establish trust and credibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What’s important to remember is that an author bio is not an <a href=\"https://adelabelin.com/2020/09/07/how-to-write-your-about-me-page-guide-for-new-bloggers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">‘About Me’ page</a> on your website. Considering that you have 50-100 words to write your author bio, you need to make it punchy and valuable.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s take a look at the seven best practices to help you craft compelling author bios.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Keep it brief, impactful, and interesting</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though your readers are interested to know about you and learn more about your experience, you don’t want to bore them with a long and extensive author bio.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This will in turn make you lose your credibility and turn your readers off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep your bio short, crisp and interesting, typically under 150 words. Only list your major accomplishments and other relevant and important information.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you have won a lot of awards, or have multiple published works, put down your most impressive ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"842\" height=\"264\" src=\"https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/author-bio-example.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-305\" srcset=\"https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/author-bio-example.png 842w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/author-bio-example-300x94.png 300w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/author-bio-example-768x241.png 768w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/author-bio-example-640x201.png 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 842px) 100vw, 842px\" /><figcaption><a href=\"https://angiefox.com/\">source</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Write in third-person</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It is a good practice to write your author bio in the third person instead of first because the former makes it look more professional.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Writing your author bio in the third person makes it look like it has been written by an objective observer, making it easier for readers to trust.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, instead of writing “I have been a photographer for 4 years”, you should write “[Your Name] has been a photographer for 4 years”.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"824\" height=\"483\" src=\"https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/author-bio-example-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-306\" srcset=\"https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/author-bio-example-1.png 824w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/author-bio-example-1-300x176.png 300w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/author-bio-example-1-768x450.png 768w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/author-bio-example-1-640x375.png 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px\" /><figcaption><a href=\"http://www.adamsilvera.com/\">source</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>State your area of expertise or niche</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It is important to establish your skills and the values you provide for the niche you write on, to let your readers understand that you have authority on your subject and there’s a reason why they would be interested in what you have to say.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider telling readers about:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>What do you write about?&nbsp;</li><li>What is your area of expertise?</li><li>What <a href=\"https://adelabelin.com/2020/07/07/how-to-choose-a-niche-for-your-blog-6-smart-tactics/\">niche</a> do you specialize in?</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t sway your readers away by sharing your dreams and hopes.

If it doesn’t, it&#8217;s advisable to remove it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t ramble on about your achievements. Pick the best ones and add them up to your bio.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"318\" src=\"https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/author-bio-example-3-1024x318.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-308\" srcset=\"https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/author-bio-example-3-1024x318.png 1024w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/author-bio-example-3-300x93.png 300w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/author-bio-example-3-768x238.png 768w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/author-bio-example-3-640x199.png 640w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/author-bio-example-3.png 1179w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.bookbub.com/authors/june-hur\">source</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Add a personal touch</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Add a little bit of your personality, some personal interests, or hobbies into your bio for your readers to feel a sense of familiarity and relatability to you as a person.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This brings color and life into words and can lead them to imagine who the author is. Be appropriate, witty, and specific, as this works wonders for your audience and makes you a more interesting person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep these extra personal tidbits broad enough for a larger number of people to associate with them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if you play the tambourine, state that you have been playing a musical instrument for X number of years.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"720\" height=\"403\" src=\"https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/author-bio-example-4.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-309\" srcset=\"https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/author-bio-example-4.png 720w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/author-bio-example-4-300x168.png 300w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/author-bio-example-4-640x358.png 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\" /><figcaption><a href=\"https://laurelinpaige.com/\">source</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Give them a way to connect with you</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a good idea to mention your website link and social media channels, giving people a way to connect with you if they want to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adding social media links to your author bio makes it easier for your readers to form a bond with you. This can potentially lead to referrals and can help build your network which is great for online content creators.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/author-bio-example-5-1024x426.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-310\" srcset=\"https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/author-bio-example-5-1024x426.png 1024w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/author-bio-example-5-300x125.png 300w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/author-bio-example-5-768x319.png 768w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/author-bio-example-5-640x266.png 640w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/author-bio-example-5.png 1092w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption><a href=\"https://dianaurban.com/\">source</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Use a professional photograph</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To <a href=\"https://adelabelin.com/2020/11/04/capture-attention-and-drive-traffic-with-catchy-headlines-7-ideas-for-blog-titles/\">capture the attention</a> of your target readers, use a high-quality, smiling, and professional image in your bio that doesn&#8217;t have a distracting background.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This will put a face to your name.

      "content": "\n<p>You’ve finally decided to write a blog post, but when you sit to write, no ideas come to mind. Nothing. Zilch. Nada.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You try and think about topics that you could write about, or take inspiration from an event in your life, but your mind is completely blank. This is exactly what having writer’s block entails, and you guessed it right: it is every blogger’s worst nightmare.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7TKyhhUW9gVsHiF2/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Every blogger goes through a spell of writer’s block at least once in their life.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article, I’m going to take you through writing exercises for writer’s block that can be used to inspire creativity and get yourself out of the rut.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>7 Effective Writing Exercises for Writer’s Block</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When you’re going through writer’s block, it can feel permanent and you might think you’ll never get out of it. Let me tell you, it’s far from the truth.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are seven effective writing exercises to help you conquer writer&#8217;s block and get writing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Set an assigned time to write</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To make something a regular habit, you should consciously make an effort to work on it. Set aside a chunk of time to blog every day &#8212; even for just half an hour. Hold your <a href=\"https://adelabelin.com/2020/03/26/blogging-for-business-6-reasons-to-start-a-blog/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">blogging</a> time with the same importance that you would give an appointment or a deadline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don’t expect to blog when you think you “feel creative”, because eventually, distractions occur that will, in turn, take you away from writing your blog and then you find yourself stuck with writer’s block.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only way to overcome it is by disciplining yourself to write regularly. It’s a good idea to set a reminder on your phone, reminding you to write.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Write down your ideas</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s good practice to keep a notepad in your vicinity so that you can jot down any impromptu ideas or thoughts that might come to you over your day. If not a notepad, even a note-taking app on your phone works just as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can use the voice recorder on your phone for this purpose as well because you never really know when inspiration hits.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This exercise intends you to always have backup ideas that you relate to and can write about when you want to overcome writer’s block. If you let these creative ideas pass by, and not write them down, you might end up forgetting about them completely and regret losing out on some viable ideas.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Monitor trending topics</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There is new content being posted on the internet every second. Today, it has become comparatively simple to find out what your audience is searching for, what people are interested in, and what is the viral news at the moment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think about the amount of new information or topics that you would miss out on if you do not regularly keep checking for them and being updated with the latest trends that are being discussed online. This helps you stay up-to-date with what’s popular and write relevant and relatable content for your blogs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make it a point to browse on Twitter, <a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Google Trends</a>, and other online discussion forums like Quora or Reddit, every day to see what topics are being discussed and have the maximum engagement or which news is a high-level priority among your audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Browsing these pages will give you more ideas and help you fill your <a href=\"https://adelabelin.com/2020/06/10/how-to-create-an-editorial-calendar-for-your-blog-6-pro-tips/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">editorial calendar</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alternatively, you can also use content discovery tools such as BuzzSumo or SEMRush that pick out specific trending topics according to your blog’s target audience and niche, without you having to manually search for what’s trending on the internet.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Change your writing environment</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Sit in a different place than you usually sit to write. Change your environment. This could influence you to notice something in the other room that you can write about or could even be a trigger to a memory or an incident which you can use as a base for your blog post’s content.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure to find a place where you feel more productive and alert, where you can write without any distractions. If a workstation desk doesn’t help you with your thinking process, creativity and focus, it’s always a better option to work on the couch or on the balcony, where you are comfortable and relaxed.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On another note, sometimes writing in a coffee shop can also encourage inspiration.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Update your older posts</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One easy way to <a href=\"https://adelabelin.com/2020/03/01/how-to-blog-consistently-and-never-run-out-of-content/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">not run out of content</a> is to use your older posts that were published months or maybe even years ago, which are now out-dated and less accurate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These posts can be looked upon, revised, and updated according to how relevant and resourceful it is in the present time. Even more so, you could write a completely new post on the same topic, using fresher resources and data.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By updating your dated blog posts, the quality of the content will also continually improve. You will appear to have more authority and knowledge over your blog niche and the topics your readers come to your blog to read about.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Freewrite</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes it&#8217;s better to stop thinking for a moment and just write about anything that comes to your mind.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you write non-stop, your subconscious mind discovers deeper and more intricate thoughts, that the conscious mind does not let out. Consequently, the main purpose of this process is to free your mind and attain your creative flow.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/dwFWfiMr4hyHMqym8Y/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some guidelines you should consider while freewriting:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Don’t focus on grammatical or spelling errors as this is just a rough draft to express your thoughts;</li><li>Designate a certain amount of time to freewrite;</li><li>Let the ideas and thoughts come to you;</li><li>Don&#8217;t critique your thoughts. Even if some of them don&#8217;t make sense now, they could be of use when you need to find new content for your posts;</li><li>After your time is up, read your draft again to find good ideas and topics.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Consider doing a round-up post</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Roundup posts are basically a culmination of content and opinions from the experts in your blog’s niche.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, a round-up post on ‘8 brilliant ‘how-to’ blog posts you must read’ will basically list out blogs of the various experts who have written quality how-to blog posts, giving them credit for their knowledge and authority about certain topics or a particular field.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider doing a roundup post when you have no ideas coming up for your blog. This is an easy exercise to implement and will also bring in massive engagement from your readers and the other influencers who are mentioned in your roundup blog post.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In conclusion, it is extremely important to know where to start and how to go about your blog posts, once you get stuck in writer’s block.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your blog is linked to your income, outdated and lack of creative content can harm your financials and bring your blog down.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, finding ways to get motivated for writing new content even though you have no idea what to write about will eventually bring success to your blog and these seven writing exercises for writer&#8217;s block are here to guide you to reach that success.</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>You’ve just created a new blog, and have a lot of material to include in your first blog post. The problem is you don’t know where to begin.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Is writing a blog post supposed to be that difficult,” you wonder. Don’t worry, I got you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That being said, it is critical to know how to organize a blog post so that you can make it an effective read.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/Mdj5MGVQAv5KMtDHHe/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"/><figcaption><a href=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/Mdj5MGVQAv5KMtDHHe/giphy.gif\">Source</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to Organize a Blog Post in 9 Steps</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Organizing a blog post gives it structure, making it easier for readers to digest and process the content with ease.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let us take a look at the nine key steps you need to take to organize a blog post and structure it well.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. Create an outline</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The first step to creating content is to craft an outline of all the information that will be written about in your blog post.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This outline brings an organized structure to your content. It serves as a rough draft and helps you in the writing process by ensuring your thoughts flow in a logical manner.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your outline doesn&#8217;t need to be detailed or extensive. The purpose of an outline is to get guidance on the angle you’re taking and aspects of the topic you plan to include.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Do keyword research</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you start writing your blog post, it is recommended to do thorough keyword research.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To rank in the first few search results, you must know what specific words your target audience uses to search. Use these focus keywords in your blog post content to <a href=\"https://adelabelin.com/2020/04/16/how-to-drive-organic-traffic-and-grow-your-blog-in-2020/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">drive organic traffic</a> to your website and become more visible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can use Google’s free tool, <a href=\"https://ads.google.com/intl/en_ae/home/tools/keyword-planner/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Keyword Planner</a>, <a href=\"https://ahrefs.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Ahrefs</a>, or <a href=\"http://answerthepublic.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Answer the Public</a> to find target keywords and specific queries being asked related to your topic in question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, this is how Ahrefs’ keyword explorer tool looks like.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"869\" height=\"390\" src=\"https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ahrefs-keyword-explorer-tool-example.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-287\" srcset=\"https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ahrefs-keyword-explorer-tool-example.png 869w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ahrefs-keyword-explorer-tool-example-300x135.png 300w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ahrefs-keyword-explorer-tool-example-768x345.png 768w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ahrefs-keyword-explorer-tool-example-640x287.png 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 869px) 100vw, 869px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>However, don’t make the mistake of stuffing your article with keywords. Remember: your primary goal should be to offer value through the article.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. Hook your readers</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The introductory paragraph for all your blog posts is very important and deserves careful thought.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your introduction needs to be clear, specific, and should create a roadmap of what your blog post is about and how it would be of value to the readers. It&#8217;s the initial <a href=\"https://writersperhour.com/blog/essay-hooks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">hook</a> for your blog post that converts visitors into readers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a good idea to include the target keyword in the first 100-120 words of your article.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your introduction is weak, your readers would not be able to gauge enough interest to go on further and read the rest of your blog, regardless of how interesting the topic is.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>4. Use subheadings</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Attention spans are shrinking. Most people don&#8217;t have the patience to read an entire page of text-only content and grasp all the information present in it. That&#8217;s why using headers and subheaders is important because they help break up large paragraphs of text, making your blog post easier to scan.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It helps to break down your content, emphasize specific points, give your readers the freedom to skim through the blog post and refer to the information that they relate to or would like to read more about.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a more effective option, rather than making them read the entire blog post to get the information they require. Additionally, you could also add specific keywords to your headers for easier understanding.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>5. Include original research</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the important characteristics of a great blog post is to have it backed up with original research and credible sources.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having a data-oriented blog post with actionable and relatable key takeaways guides your blog to be perceived as an authentic platform to get correct information from, as well as builds your authority on the specific niche or topic.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/C9boARVKKFk3IioL82/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"269\"/><figcaption><a href=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/C9boARVKKFk3IioL82/giphy.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Source</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Including well-researched evidence for your claims and advice builds trust in your readers, instigating them to become loyal followers and come back to your blog again and again.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Authenticity also gets your followers to talk about your blog to others, which in turn helps gain new readers and audience traffic.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>6. Incorporate visuals</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Adding visuals in the form of <a href=\"https://adelabelin.com/2020/08/09/where-to-find-free-images-for-your-blog-10-best-websites/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">images</a>, videos, infographics, or GIFS to your blog post will grab the attention of your readers in an instant, keep them engaged, and convey a lot more than words. Thus, eventually helping people understand and digest complex, long, or text-heavy information easier.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/312551\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Visuals are processed 60,000 times faster</a> than text, making it all the more important to incorporate visuals in your blog posts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adding imagery in your blog post also breaks up your text, making it more visually appealing and less intimidating.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>7. Place a call-to-action</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Every blog post serves a purpose and that needs to be reflected in your call-to-action (CTA) button.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your readers have clicked on your blog and have reached the body of your blog post, they are most likely interested to know more about what you have to say. Your content has caught their attention.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can place the CTA halfway through your blog post, or at the end of the post. Here are some CTA ideas for blog posts:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Ask your readers to sign up to a mailing list</li><li>Subscribe to your newsletter</li><li>Share your post with their friends</li><li>Discuss in the comments section</li><li>Participate in a giveaway contest</li><li>Avail a service or buy a product</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, this is the CTA that appears at the end of every Content Marketing Institute blog post.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"499\" src=\"https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CTA-button-example-1024x499.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-288\" srcset=\"https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CTA-button-example-1024x499.png 1024w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CTA-button-example-300x146.png 300w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CTA-button-example-768x374.png 768w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CTA-button-example-640x312.png 640w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CTA-button-example.png 1349w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>8. Build inbound links</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Enhancing the site structure for your blog is key. This helps your content rank to the top of the search engines, improve your SEO, and makes it easier for Google to find your website. To achieve this, a good inbound linking strategy is very essential and should be a must-do practice for bloggers writing for any niche.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An internal link connects to another page in your website which is appropriate and relevant to the nature of your content. This should be done by placing an accurate anchor text. By adding these links, Google understands the:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The relevancy of the two linked pages</li><li>The value of the posts</li><li>The relationship between the two pages</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Following these eight essential steps to organize a blog post will help you capture attention and <a href=\"https://adelabelin.com/2020/03/06/how-to-create-engaging-content-6-tips-to-captivate-your-readers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">keep readers engaged</a>. The idea is to make it easier for people to read and digest your blog posts while delivering value.</p>\n",

Such posts do a deep dive into a problem and offer specific, actionable advice.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if you want to write about how social media can raise brand awareness, you can craft a headline such as “How to Use Social Media to Raise Brand Awareness”. This is exactly what your readers are looking for.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Formula: How to [Achieve Something Specific]</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"810\" height=\"567\" src=\"https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Easy-Homemade-Pancakes-Recipe-Kitchn-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-268\" srcset=\"https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Easy-Homemade-Pancakes-Recipe-Kitchn-1.png 810w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Easy-Homemade-Pancakes-Recipe-Kitchn-1-300x210.png 300w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Easy-Homemade-Pancakes-Recipe-Kitchn-1-768x538.png 768w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Easy-Homemade-Pancakes-Recipe-Kitchn-1-640x448.png 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Blog Title Idea #2: The Guide or Cheat Sheet Post</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Who doesn&#8217;t want a complete guide of everything there is to know about a topic of interest?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea behind such articles is to write a comprehensive post while offering a holistic view of the topic in question.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, if you’re writing an article on how to start a freelance business, you might want to talk about topics ranging from the types of freelancing and choosing your niche to finding clients and marketing your services.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Formula: The [Adjective] Guide to [Specific Subject]</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"380\" src=\"https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Remote-Work-The-Ultimate-Guide-for-Working-Remotely-Miro-1024x380.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-269\" srcset=\"https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Remote-Work-The-Ultimate-Guide-for-Working-Remotely-Miro-1024x380.png 1024w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Remote-Work-The-Ultimate-Guide-for-Working-Remotely-Miro-300x111.png 300w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Remote-Work-The-Ultimate-Guide-for-Working-Remotely-Miro-768x285.png 768w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Remote-Work-The-Ultimate-Guide-for-Working-Remotely-Miro-640x238.png 640w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Remote-Work-The-Ultimate-Guide-for-Working-Remotely-Miro.png 1304w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Blog Title Idea #3: Mistakes to Avoid Post</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Using power words like errors, mistakes and goof-ups as these are very high in attracting the reader’s attention.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having a guide about what to avoid makes your audience curious because they can relate to it and use your blog as a roadmap for the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, here’s a recent blog post I wrote on the <a href=\"https://adelabelin.com/2020/10/07/9-biggest-blogging-mistakes-to-avoid-at-all-costs/\">biggest blogging mistakes</a> one should avoid.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"822\" height=\"617\" src=\"https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/9-Biggest-Blogging-Mistakes-to-Avoid-at-All-Costs-Adela-Belin.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-270\" srcset=\"https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/9-Biggest-Blogging-Mistakes-to-Avoid-at-All-Costs-Adela-Belin.png 822w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/9-Biggest-Blogging-Mistakes-to-Avoid-at-All-Costs-Adela-Belin-300x225.png 300w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/9-Biggest-Blogging-Mistakes-to-Avoid-at-All-Costs-Adela-Belin-768x576.png 768w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/9-Biggest-Blogging-Mistakes-to-Avoid-at-All-Costs-Adela-Belin-640x480.png 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 822px) 100vw, 822px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>After all, everyone wants to know about what they should <strong>not </strong>do or mistakes they should stay away from in order to succeed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Headline Formula: X Common [Topic] Mistakes You Should Avoid</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Blog Title Idea #4: The Listicle</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A study by <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216608002798\">University of Athens</a> revealed that people preferred “creative and uninformative” types of headlines which are often seen in listicles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Listicles simplify a lot of information into one clearly structured and ordered list, helping readers grasp it with ease.

This formula works when you want to prove a surprising fact in your blog post.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Headline Formula: Why [Fact]</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"750\" height=\"591\" src=\"https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Why-Do-We-Celebrate-Halloween-Vermont-Public-Radio.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-272\" srcset=\"https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Why-Do-We-Celebrate-Halloween-Vermont-Public-Radio.png 750w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Why-Do-We-Celebrate-Halloween-Vermont-Public-Radio-300x236.png 300w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Why-Do-We-Celebrate-Halloween-Vermont-Public-Radio-640x504.png 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Blog Title Idea #6: The Best Ways Post</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is one of the most powerful headline ideas for SEO as they exact-match the common searches that people make.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think about this: you are trying to lose weight and gain muscle.

From restaurants and software to insurance packages and apparel &#8212; the options are endless.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>People want to direct their time, money and energy on the best available, so it&#8217;s always a competition between one brand and another.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These competition headlines are focused on making comparisons and distinguishing which choice is better than the other.

      "content": "\n<p><em>“It’s been a while since I have been blogging, but I haven&#8217;t seen any proper results. There isn&#8217;t enough traffic coming to my blog and I&#8217;m not getting any leads. Am I doing something wrong?”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a common scenario for new bloggers who don&#8217;t know the know-how of the blogging business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many people start a blog thinking having good writing skills is all they need to run a successful blog but that’s far from the truth.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/KWbmr5E1UdPUI/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Are You Making These Biggest Blogging Mistakes?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re wondering why your efforts are not materializing, it might be time to pause, reflect, and see where you’re going wrong.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s a look at 9 of the biggest blogging mistakes that you should avoid at all costs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mistake #1: Not defining your target audience</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When you blog for yourself, you may not need to think about your readers. But when you are blogging to strengthen your personal brand image, build your network and monetize your blog, you need to know who you are catering to.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The more insights you gain on your target audience, the better are your chances of succeeding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, research about their demographics, challenges, and expectations. This will help you create posts that offer solutions to their questions and challenges.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mistake #2: Publishing duplicate and poor content</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Publishing duplicate content is likely to hurt your search engine traffic.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google requires websites to publish original content that educates, guides, entertains, and influences readers. This increases search engine rankings and <a href=\"https://adelabelin.com/2020/04/16/how-to-drive-organic-traffic-and-grow-your-blog-in-2020/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">drives organic traffic</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, take time to create high-quality, valuable content that engages your readers and offers actionable advice.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mistake #3: Not being consistent</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The key to being a successful blogger is being consistent.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Readers want to see fresh, interesting content. Posting in an unpredictable pattern will get your readers frustrated and in due course, they may choose to stop reading your blog. Eventually, this could send your site rankings on a downward spiral.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/2yLB9xLkpGaMU/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, it’s a good idea to create a blog <a href=\"https://adelabelin.com/2020/06/10/how-to-create-an-editorial-calendar-for-your-blog-6-pro-tips/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">editorial calendar</a>. This will help you schedule your posts and ensure you have a steady stream of articles in the pipeline.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mistake #4: Failing to cite sources</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It is always considered as good writing practice to cite your sources properly and give due credit to original sources whenever required.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from protecting you from unintentional plagiarism, citing research studies and statistical data is a good way to back your statements while adding credibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mistake #5: Not using visuals</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Have you ever come across a blog post that did not have images, and was just filled with text?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Did it manage to retain your attention or did you find yourself getting overwhelmed by the sheer overload of information?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your blog needs to be visually appealing as images can bring life to words. As you write, you’ll notice that long paragraphs of continuous text can get very monotonous.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Use visuals in the form of:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://adelabelin.com/2020/08/09/where-to-find-free-images-for-your-blog-10-best-websites/\">Static images</a></li><li>Videos</li><li>Infographics</li><li>Charts and graphs</li><li>GIFs</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure the images you include are relevant and complement your blog post, helping you convey the message with ease.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mistake #6: Not engaging with your readers</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The comment section on your blog helps you know about your readers, what kind of content they want to see, what more you can do to build your blog.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It basically builds a relationship with them so that you develop a loyal readership.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest blogging mistake for new bloggers would be to ignore these comments because then you would end up losing credibility, and leave a bad impression on your readers. Be yourself and personally reply to the comments you receive on your posts. This shows that you are reading each comment and are valuing their feedback and opinions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take a look at a snippet from Neil Patel’s comments section. He always makes it a point to reply to the comments and engage with his readers.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"735\" height=\"382\" src=\"https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/neil-pateo-comments-section-example.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-260\" srcset=\"https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/neil-pateo-comments-section-example.png 735w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/neil-pateo-comments-section-example-300x156.png 300w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/neil-pateo-comments-section-example-640x333.png 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 735px) 100vw, 735px\" /><figcaption><a href=\"https://neilpatel.com/blog/best-blogging-platforms/\">Source</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mistake #7: Not building an email list</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Email is one of the most personalized forms of communication. In fact, <a href=\"https://contentmarketinginstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2020_B2B_Research_Final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">87% of B2B marketers</a> say email is one of their top free organic distribution channels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This means that as a blogger, it’s imperative to start building an email list from the very first day.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can use email newsletters to send out updates and notify your readers about new blog posts while strengthening relationships.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can create an opt-in form and encourage readers to subscribe to your email newsletters. These can be placed on your blog homepage, contact us, and <a href=\"https://adelabelin.com/2020/09/07/how-to-write-your-about-me-page-guide-for-new-bloggers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">about page</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s an example of an opt-in form on The Blonde Abroad’s homepage.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"964\" height=\"317\" src=\"https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/blonde-abroad-homepage-example.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-261\" srcset=\"https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/blonde-abroad-homepage-example.png 964w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/blonde-abroad-homepage-example-300x99.png 300w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/blonde-abroad-homepage-example-768x253.png 768w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/blonde-abroad-homepage-example-640x210.png 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 964px) 100vw, 964px\" /><figcaption><a href=\"https://theblondeabroad.com/\">Source</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mistake #8: Stuffing SEO keywords</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Including SEO keywords on your blog to reach a higher search rate on Google is a very important step. However, it is a bad idea to stuff your blog posts with tons of SEO keywords and phrases.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>SEO stuffing is a spam technique that bloggers assume will take their web page to the top of the search engine results. But instead, it gets your blog page flagged if Google detects the misdemeanor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Always aim for a <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262852700_Keyword_stuffing_and_the_big_three_search_engines\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">keyword density of no more than 3-4%</a> of your blog posts. This will help in achieving traction and higher search results.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mistake #9: Having a poor blog design</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You can write the most informative posts but if your blog design isn’t conducive, there’s no way it’s going to capture and retain attention.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might think of using dark tones and backgrounds with light-colored fonts just to give your blog page an edge and make it creative but how readable are your posts?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Focus on making your posts readable. So, stick to a simple layout, legible fonts, and complementary colors. Playing around with too many fonts and colors is sure to create confusion and leave your readers overwhelmed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion: Avoid These Biggest Blogging Mistakes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Blogging is not as simple and straightforward as it seems. In addition to creating good content, it’s important to strike a relationship with your readers and be consistent in your efforts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For starters, stay away from these biggest blogging mistakes and that is sure to take you closer to growing your blog effectively.</p>\n",

It gives you the opportunity to promote your brand and position yourself as an authority in your <a href=\"https://adelabelin.com/2020/07/07/how-to-choose-a-niche-for-your-blog-6-smart-tactics/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">blog niche</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/XdUMYCpkhoAt9UkHPT/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to Write Your About Me Page: 8 Best Practices</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you’ve <a href=\"https://adelabelin.com/2020/04/16/how-to-drive-organic-traffic-and-grow-your-blog-in-2020/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">attracted traffic</a> to your ‘about me’ page, how do you engage them and make them want to know more about you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To make it easier for all you new bloggers out there, here are eight tips to help you craft the perfect ‘about me’ page.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tell your story and make it engaging&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When writing about yourself, it&#8217;s difficult to figure out what you should say and how much. You do not have to write about your entire life in this section, but always give enough information that matters to you and is relevant to your target audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea is to make it interesting and easy to read. You don’t want to bore people with the irrelevant details of your life. Instead, focus on aspects that will pique your readers’ interests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if you’re a food blogger, use this space to talk about your journey and what inspired you to start a food blog.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1020\" height=\"740\" src=\"https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/how-to-write-your-about-me-page-example.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-247\" srcset=\"https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/how-to-write-your-about-me-page-example.png 1020w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/how-to-write-your-about-me-page-example-300x218.png 300w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/how-to-write-your-about-me-page-example-768x557.png 768w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/how-to-write-your-about-me-page-example-640x464.png 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1020px) 100vw, 1020px\" /><figcaption><a href=\"https://sayyes.com/\">https://sayyes.com/</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Inject personality</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are so many bloggers out there. Why should someone read your blog?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The answer lies in your unique personality. Showcase it to differentiate yourself from the other bloggers, giving people a reason to <a href=\"https://adelabelin.com/2020/03/06/how-to-create-engaging-content-6-tips-to-captivate-your-readers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">engage with your content</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your readers will want to see what kind of a person you are and how you express yourself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, write in your own distinctive style and don’t shy away from being humorous. This is the section about <strong>you</strong>, and what you would like your readers to know as they browse through your website.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Be authentic</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t try to be somebody else. Be true to your readers and reflect genuine interest in what you choose to write in your posts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if you hate eating healthy and exercising, don&#8217;t claim to be a fitness enthusiast or write about healthy diets, supplements, and weight-loss formulas. This could lead to your followers consuming false information and losing their trust in what you write.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Demonstrate your expertise</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is your 4-line elevator pitch, so you know that you’ve got to give it all. Expertise in your particular field of writing is the utmost priority because, at the end of the day, the readers don&#8217;t really care about who you are but what they can learn from you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To offer value through your blog, you need to have knowledge or experience in that particular field. So shed some background on the type of subject matter you write about and what your niche area is. Your readers would want to know how you can help them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s not all, this is also a good opportunity to build credibility and have your readers instil trust in you. You can do that by showcasing client testimonials, your published guest posts on authoritative websites and media coverage such as interviews, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"512\" height=\"249\" src=\"https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/about-me-page-example.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-248\" srcset=\"https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/about-me-page-example.png 512w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/about-me-page-example-300x146.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" /><figcaption><a href=\"https://kevintpayne.com/about/\">source</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Include a high-quality hero image</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Make a good impression of yourself and create a connection. To do that, always include a picture of yourself in your ‘about me’ section &#8212; smiling, recent and non-offensive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This will help your readers relate to the writer and they will be able to connect a face to your name. The warmth of that first impression will work wonders for your blog and help your readership gain momentum.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"797\" height=\"737\" src=\"https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/how-to-write-your-about-me-page-3.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-249\" srcset=\"https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/how-to-write-your-about-me-page-3.png 797w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/how-to-write-your-about-me-page-3-300x277.png 300w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/how-to-write-your-about-me-page-3-768x710.png 768w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/how-to-write-your-about-me-page-3-640x592.png 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 797px) 100vw, 797px\" /><figcaption><a href=\"https://ohmydogblog.com/\">source</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Place a call-to-action</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>What do you want your readers to do after reading the ‘about me’ section? That is what you need to communicate through a clear and strong call-to-action (CTA) button.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, do you want them to follow you on social media, subscribe to your newsletter, take your online course or something else?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Placing a CTA button encourages action.

From doing research and writing in-depth content to being grammatically-correct &#8212; you thought you had done it all.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Time to introspect, don&#8217;t you think?</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/5QW76Ww9bquHdg1fTv/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps what was missing was the visual appeal.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why are Visuals Important for your Blog?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>“A picture is worth a thousand words,” they say and rightly so.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Human beings are visual creatures. When the brain encounters a piece of communication, it processes visuals about <a href=\"http://misrc.umn.edu/workingpapers/fullpapers/1986/8611.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">60,000 times faster</a> than it does words. In fact, 90% of information transmitted to the brain is visual.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Images grab our attention in an instant and convey a lot more than words, helping people understand and digest information with ease.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine this: you are met with a lot of data and information. It’s certainly a little difficult to process them all at once, but when you place them in an infographic, it takes hardly a minute to comprehend all the information, right?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Images keep readers <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://adelabelin.com/2020/03/06/how-to-create-engaging-content-6-tips-to-captivate-your-readers/\" target=\"_blank\">engaged</a> and make them feel like they can relate to your blog. A huge chunk of text will never grab as much attention the way visual imagery does.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>10 Websites to Find Free Images for your Blog</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While you need images for your blog, you can’t use any picture that is available on the internet. There are legalities involved and rules that you need to follow.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, don’t make the mistake of posting a picture that you found via a Google search as you’re likely to encounter copyright issues.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The good news is that there are a plethora of websites where you can find free images for your blog that don’t come with copyright restrictions and are published under the Creative Commons licenses.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s a look at the 10 best websites to source beautiful imagery for your blog posts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://pixabay.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Pixabay</a></h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"573\" src=\"https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pixabay-homepage-1024x573.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-230\" srcset=\"https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pixabay-homepage-1024x573.png 1024w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pixabay-homepage-300x168.png 300w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pixabay-homepage-768x429.png 768w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pixabay-homepage-640x358.png 640w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pixabay-homepage.png 1420w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most popular stock images websites, Pixabay is a comprehensive free-to-use photo website that comprises more than 1.8 million free high-resolution stock images, vectors, illustrations, and videos for any and all commercial use.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pixabay lets the user filter the image results by orientation (horizontal or vertical), size, and even color.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://unsplash.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Unsplash</a></h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"518\" src=\"https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Unsplash-homepage-1024x518.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-231\" srcset=\"https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Unsplash-homepage-1024x518.png 1024w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Unsplash-homepage-300x152.png 300w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Unsplash-homepage-768x389.png 768w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Unsplash-homepage-640x324.png 640w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Unsplash-homepage.png 1439w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Unsplash covers 1 million stock photos and makes it a point to add 10 new images every single day.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their images are categorized into specific topics like travel, nature, business &amp; work ethics, people, etc. for easier searchability.

Terrifying, isn’t it?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether it’s the lack of topics to write about or loss of interest, the truth is that you chose a blog niche on a whim and now you’re stuck with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/al7hG5GiD4hzO/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Picking a blog niche is like choosing a partner &#8212; you need to be interested in it to be invested in it. After all the effort you put into starting a blog, you want to choose a niche that helps you expand readership and grow your blog.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article, I’ll tell you how to choose a niche for your blog that you won’t regret months later.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>5 Tactics to Choose the Right Blog Niche</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Choosing a blog niche might sound like a straightforward affair but let me tell you, it’s not. It’s important to spend a good amount of time brainstorming and doing research before you finally take the decision.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“<em>But I can write about motherhood, college life, home décor and money-saving hacks</em>..”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Good for you but not the best way to <a href=\"https://adelabelin.com/2020/03/26/blogging-for-business-6-reasons-to-start-a-blog/\">start a blog</a>. Picking a blog niche is essential because it helps you focus your blogging efforts and find a targeted audience. You have to aim to be an expert in the niche rather than writing about everything yet nothing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The niche you select needs to be a mix of your interests, skills and experience, along with having a potential to be profitable in the long run.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are five tactics to help you choose a niche for your blog.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Brainstorm niche ideas</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Open a blank document and do a complete brain dump &#8212; yes, jot down every blog niche that you can think of. Consider these questions for a productive brainstorming session:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>What interests you?</li><li>What are you passionate about?</li><li>What are your hobbies?</li><li>What is your educational and professional background?</li><li>What are the kind of articles, books and magazines you read?</li><li>What kind of content do you enjoy reading and watching?</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>By the end of this step, you’ll be left with a list of blog niche ideas. Some examples include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://adelabelin.com/2020/05/16/how-to-start-a-lifestyle-blog-a-step-by-step-guide/\">Lifestyle</a></li><li>Fashion</li><li>Home décor</li><li>Freelancing&nbsp;</li><li>Entertainment&nbsp;</li><li>Blogging&nbsp;</li><li>Cooking and recipes</li><li>Travel</li><li>Fitness</li><li>Technology</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember &#8212; the niche you pick should not be too broad or narrow. A broad niche won’t be focussed enough and a narrow one won’t make for a sustainable option in the long run.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s say you’re interested in food and cooking. While you can start a food blog, why not narrow it down to healthy recipes, vegan recipes or even one focussed on a specific cuisine.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Do keyword research</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The purpose of keyword research is to understand how many people are searching for topics related to the niche of your choice. In other words, it tells you if there’s a demand for the niche in the market.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Ahrefs is my go-to tool for keyword research, if you don’t have an account yet, you can also use Google’s Keyword Planner to do keyword research.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All you have to do is enter the broad keywords in the search bar and you’ll get access to the average monthly searches for the respective terms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s an example for ‘vegan recipes’, ‘healthy recipes’ and ‘healthy dishes’. With around 7,300 keyword ideas and high average monthly searches for these keywords, it’s safe to say that starting a healthy food blog is a good idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"685\" height=\"539\" src=\"https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/google-webmaster-tool-screenshot-with-statistic.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-211\" srcset=\"https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/google-webmaster-tool-screenshot-with-statistic.png 685w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/google-webmaster-tool-screenshot-with-statistic-300x236.png 300w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/google-webmaster-tool-screenshot-with-statistic-640x504.png 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 685px) 100vw, 685px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Repeat this step for each of the niches you brainstormed and evaluate their individual potential.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Check trends and forums</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So you’ve done the necessary keyword research to understand if people even care about the list of potential niches you listed out.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next step is to dig a little deeper and understand if the niche is growing or decreasing in interest. <a href=\"https://trends.google.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Google Trends</a> is the perfect tool for finding this out.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that’s a healthy graph for ‘vegan recipes’ &#8212; it shows a consistent performance in searches.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"512\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/google-trends-screenshot.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-212\" srcset=\"https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/google-trends-screenshot.png 512w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/google-trends-screenshot-300x156.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to this, you should also browse forums such as Quora and Reddit to understand <strong>what</strong> people want to read about in the particular niche.

Hence, it’s extremely important to evaluate how profitable the blog niche is before you go all-out.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What decides profitability? The ability to get your audience to pay for your products, services or content in the particular niche.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A good way to check if your blog niche ideas are profitable is to browse Amazon. Being the largest online retailer, it helps you understand if people are paying money to buy products related to the niches you’re considering.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"424\" src=\"https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/amazon-search-results-example-1024x424.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-215\" srcset=\"https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/amazon-search-results-example-1024x424.png 1024w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/amazon-search-results-example-300x124.png 300w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/amazon-search-results-example-768x318.png 768w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/amazon-search-results-example-640x265.png 640w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/amazon-search-results-example.png 1333w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Do a competitor analysis</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Entering a blog niche that is crowded with competitors decreases your chances of being heard. Another way to look at this is to find the competitors in your blog niche, study the kind of content they post and find a unique angle that will set you apart from the rest.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s also a good idea to check their comments section to see how their content is being received and identify gaps you could address in your blog.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>5 Successful Bloggers with Focussed Blog

There will be days when you will be filled with ideas and others when you won’t know what to write about.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/uDRezGbZW1uo0/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>But hey &#8212; there are bloggers who have been publishing a consistent stream of articles every week for years together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wondering how they achieve that? By creating an editorial calendar for their blog.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A blog editorial calendar is hugely underrated. People don’t realize the kind of discipline it brings to one’s blogging efforts. From brainstorming ideas to writing, publishing and promoting content &#8212; having an editorial calendar for your blog gives you a much-needed bird’s eye view.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article, I’ll take you through six tried-and-tested tips to build a robust editorial calendar for your blog.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>6 Tips to Build an Editorial Calendar for your Blog</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>An editorial calendar should not be looked at as additional work &#8212; it forms the skeleton of the blog. It gives it direction and purpose while helping you <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://adelabelin.com/2020/03/01/how-to-blog-consistently-and-never-run-out-of-content/\" target=\"_blank\">blog consistently</a> and increase readership.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s not all, if you’re working with a team, an editorial calendar for your blog ensures everyone is aligned and chasing the same goals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s take a look at how you can create a blog editorial calendar and become more consistent.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. Establish blogging frequency</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>“How often should I publish blog posts” &#8212; this is an important question to ask yourself before you start working on the editorial calendar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might think posting daily is the fastest way to grow your blog but that’s not true. You need to give your blog posts time to get the visibility they deserve and gain traction. HubSpot recommends smaller, brand-awareness focused blogs to post <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/blogging-frequency-benchmarks\" target=\"_blank\">one to two times a week</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, if you’re a one-man army and are unable to do so, it’s fine as long as you opt for publishing regularly. For instance, you cannot publish three consecutive posts and disappear for two months. Instead, be realistic about establishing your blogging frequency and commit to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Decide content buckets</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While you can brainstorm a host of topics and create content surrounding it, why not go a step further and create content buckets first?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating content buckets refers to categorizing posts under different themes, helping you meet specific needs or cater to specific audiences. So, start with identifying your blogging goals &#8212; building brand awareness? Educating readers? <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://adelabelin.com/2020/04/16/how-to-drive-organic-traffic-and-grow-your-blog-in-2020/\" target=\"_blank\">Driving traffic</a>? Establishing expertise?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Accordingly create content buckets for each of the goals. For instance, while developing the blogging strategy for <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://writersperhour.com/blog\" target=\"_blank\">Writers Per Hour</a>, we created three key themes:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Informational (eg. 7 Creative Graduation Speech Ideas that Will Get You a Standing Ovation);</li><li>Educational (eg. The Complete 8-Point Essay Checklist for Students);</li><li>Entertaining (eg. 17 Hilarious Essay Writing Tweets Every Student Can Relate To).</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>While they all had the same overarching message, they included a different set of topics.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. Create a template</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating a template streamlines the blogging process while ensuring you’re including and tracking the key components involved in writing a blog post.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>11 elements you must include in the editorial calendar for your blog</h4>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Content headline</li><li>Content bucket/theme</li><li>Number of words</li><li>Blog writer</li><li>Due date</li><li>Publish date</li><li>Last edited date</li><li>Published article link</li><li>Target keyword</li><li>Call-to-action</li><li>Social media status</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s what my editorial calendar template looks like.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"212\" src=\"https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/editorial-calendar-template-in-excel-1024x212.png\" alt=\"editorial-calendar-template-in-excel\" class=\"wp-image-202\" srcset=\"https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/editorial-calendar-template-in-excel-1024x212.png 1024w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/editorial-calendar-template-in-excel-300x62.png 300w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/editorial-calendar-template-in-excel-768x159.png 768w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/editorial-calendar-template-in-excel-640x132.png 640w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/editorial-calendar-template-in-excel.png 1315w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>4. Use reliable tools</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Tools make it easier to manage an editorial calendar for your blog. All you have to do is upload the template you created in the previous step and plug in content. Not only does it save you time, it also lets you organize articles more effectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>List of tools you can use to build your blog editorial calendar</h4>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Google spreadsheets (This one’s my personal favorite)</li><li>Trello</li><li>CoSchedule</li><li>HubSpot</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>5. Brainstorm topic and keyword ideas</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, it’s time to fill those gaps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Start by brainstorming broad-level topic ideas that would be relevant to your niche and readers. It’s a good idea to jot down those ideas in a separate brainstorming spreadsheet and keep adding to it as and when you get new ideas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next thing you need to do is finding the right target keywords. I find <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://ahrefs.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ahrefs</a>’ Keyword Explorer to be an effective tool for this exercise. Enter the broad topic and the tool will offer a host of keyword ideas and commonly asked questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, here are the keyword ideas for ‘make pancakes’.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"367\" src=\"https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ahrefs-keyword-tool-example-1024x367.png\" alt=\"ahrefs-keyword-tool-example\" class=\"wp-image-203\" srcset=\"https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ahrefs-keyword-tool-example-1024x367.png 1024w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ahrefs-keyword-tool-example-300x107.png 300w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ahrefs-keyword-tool-example-768x275.png 768w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ahrefs-keyword-tool-example-640x229.png 640w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ahrefs-keyword-tool-example.png 1134w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s important to optimize your blog post for the right target keyword in order to boost visibility and attract relevant traffic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another place you can check to get topic ideas is the ‘searches related to..’ section on the search engine results page (SERP).</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"550\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/search-engine-results-page-example.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-204\" srcset=\"https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/search-engine-results-page-example.png 550w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/search-engine-results-page-example-300x172.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>This tells you what people are commonly searching for and what the dominant <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://ahrefs.com/blog/search-intent/\" target=\"_blank\">search intent</a> is, helping you create content that people want to read.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>6. Keep updating the calendar</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Your blog editorial calendar is not written in stone. It’s important to continually keep track of the latest happenings and make improvements in the calendar.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While evergreen content will always remain relevant, it’s a good idea to leverage trends to create seasonal content. It shows that you’re aware of what’s happening in the world and lets your blog piggyback on the traction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, let’s say, you’re a home décor blog &#8212; as we know, the coronavirus pandemic outbreak has got everyone working from home. Keeping that in mind, you can write a blog post on home office decoration or small office décor ideas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, be flexible and keep space for making changes in your calendar.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Takeaway: Create an Editorial Calendar for your Blog</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re serious about blogging and want to grow your blog, it’s imperative to create a blog editorial calendar that brings order to the chaos.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only does it help you plan and organize content, it also saves you time and lets you focus on the more important tasks at hand.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, don’t take editorial calendars lightly &#8212; follow these six tips to create one that accelerates your blog growth.</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>How many times have you come across a fun and engaging lifestyle blog only to think, “I wish I could do that too”?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, guess what &#8212; you can. Starting a lifestyle blog might seem intimidating but it isn’t rocket science. Yes, you need a considerable amount of planning, a clear objective and consistency but hey, nothing comes easy does it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, stop being a bystander and jump right in.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/l0HlCVuoqZU63Ug2k/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article, I’m going to take you through a step-by-step guide on how to start a lifestyle blog. Trust me, it’s easier than you think.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to Start a Lifestyle Blog in 6 Easy Steps</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A lifestyle blogger’s life might seem glamorous and fun but there’s a lot that goes behind it. Before you start your blog, it’s important to set a clear objective and pick a target audience.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Who are you writing for &#8212; College students? Working women? Mothers? Middle-aged women?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you pick a specific target audience, it gets easier to focus your blogging efforts and appeal to them. Don’t be that person who tries to make everyone happy because you can’t.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/HhTXt43pk1I1W/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, that’s a truthbomb right there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, let’s get down to business &#8212; here’s how you can start a lifestyle blog in 6 simple steps.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. Pick your niche</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Lifestyle is a massive category. It covers:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Fashion</li><li>Beauty</li><li>Food</li><li>Recipes</li><li>Travel</li><li>Money &amp; Finances</li><li>Motherhood</li><li>Home decor&nbsp;</li><li>Family</li><li>Mental Health</li><li>College Life</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>..and a lot more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lifestyle blogging essentially constitutes writing about different aspects of your life. While you can have overlaps, what’s important is to know where your focus lies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you’re picking a niche, you need to take a couple of factors into consideration such as:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Where do your interests lie?</li><li>How popular is the niche?&nbsp;</li><li>Do you have the scope to monetize it?</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, fashion blogs might be the most popular type of blog but does fashion interest you? Can you think of 20 topic ideas related to fashion?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If not then you should think harder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a very important step that sets the foundation for your blog. So, do a little brainstorming and choose a niche that lets you demonstrate your interests, add value and most importantly, enjoy the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Name your blog</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve come across bloggers who’ve named their blog on a whim and regretted it later. Naming a blog is like naming your child.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But hey, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52557291\" target=\"_blank\">Elon Musk named his child X Æ A-12</a> so…</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"598\" height=\"575\" src=\"https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/daily-show-tweet-about-elon-musk.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-177\" srcset=\"https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/daily-show-tweet-about-elon-musk.png 598w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/daily-show-tweet-about-elon-musk-300x288.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 598px) 100vw, 598px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, let’s not get that gutsy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You need to come up with a name that’s in line with your niche and target audience. Needless to say, it needs to be unique, catchy and easy to search. For example, a blog name that’s too long and complicated might not ring a bell that easily.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are a few tactics you can use to come up with a good name for your lifestyle blog:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Make a list of keywords related to your niche and do a mash up (eg. Money Saving Mom)</li><li>Use alliterations (eg. Cats Who Code)</li><li>Use puns (eg. Two Peas in a Blog)</li><li>Add your name (eg. A Cup of Jo)</li><li>Make words up using a tool such as <a href=\"https://wordoid.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Wordoid</a> (eg. Blogilates)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you finalize the name, do check if the domain name is available. The last thing you want is to pick a blog name that’s already been taken.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. Select the blog hosting platform</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You don’t need to be a coder to take your blog live. All you have to do is select the right blogging and hosting platforms. Just the way you need to rent a place to live, the same logic applies to blogs &#8212; a web hosting platform is essential to launch your blog.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With so many options available, it can get difficult to narrow down on one. So, let’s first understand what you need to look for while making your selection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You need to select a hosting platform that’s easy-to-use and gives you the flexibility to customize your lifestyle blog according to your needs. Ensure it promises a quick loading speed, is safe and comes with SEO features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a beginner, I’d advise you to start with a WordPress blog because it’s fuss-free and easily compatible with most hosting platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some of the most trusted web hosts you can use in conjunction with WordPress:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bluehost.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Bluehost</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.dreamhost.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Dreamhost</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.hostgator.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">HostGator</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.siteground.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">SiteGround</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.hostinger.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Hostinger</a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>While you might be tempted to settle for free web hosting services, I’d urge you to rethink your decision. You need to think long-term. If you’re looking to scale your blog quickly and turn it into a profitable business, free hosting is certainly <strong>not </strong>for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>4. Design your blog</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s a lot riding on your blog design. Regardless of how pathbreaking your content is, if the layout is cluttered and complicated, there’s no way you can retain readers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The good news is with a WordPress themed blog, it’s easier than ever to pick and choose a design theme for your blog. Make sure the layout is clean and simple. It should be easy to navigate and deliver a user-friendly experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The design should reflect your personality and the core idea of your blog. For instance, if you’re blogging about motherhood, use warm imagery and pastel colors to demonstrate it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don’t make the mistake of using too many colors and fonts. Stick to 2-3 font styles and colors and you should be good to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>5. Devise a content strategy</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Many bloggers make the mistake of excitedly starting a blog and writing a few posts in succession only to realize that they have nothing more to write about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Call it lack of planning or <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://adelabelin.com/category/motivation/\" target=\"_blank\">motivation to blog</a> &#8212; the truth is, you’ve started a blog and you don’t know what to do with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is why devising a powerful content strategy is so important. It helps you organize your blogging efforts and lets you adopt a more consistent approach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, put together a content calendar and track your posts. Not only does this help you plan your content, it also gives you a bird’s eye view of what’s working and what isn’t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I use Google Sheets to plan my editorial calendar. Here’s a screenshot of what it looks like.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"144\" src=\"https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/editorial-2020-google-sheets-1024x144.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-179\" srcset=\"https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/editorial-2020-google-sheets-1024x144.png 1024w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/editorial-2020-google-sheets-300x42.png 300w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/editorial-2020-google-sheets-768x108.png 768w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/editorial-2020-google-sheets-640x90.png 640w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/editorial-2020-google-sheets.png 1219w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Editorial calendar example</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>6. Start writing</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Voila! You’ve done the groundwork and set the foundation. Now, it’s about coming up with <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://adelabelin.com/2020/03/01/how-to-blog-consistently-and-never-run-out-of-content/\" target=\"_blank\">irresistible content ideas</a> and writing compelling blog posts that attract readers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s not forget that you’re writing a lifestyle blog &#8212; keep it lively, fun and light-hearted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While writing blog posts for your lifestyle blog, make sure you use a lot of graphics in the form of static images, videos, GIFs, memes, infographics and more. Don’t resort to only using stock photos. Include original photos, giving your readers a peek into your life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A first couple of posts will give you an idea on what your audience is responding to. So, keep your eyes (and ears) open and create posts that your audience will love to read and share!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion: Start your Lifestyle Blog Today</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>“How to start a lifestyle blog”, you asked and here you have your answer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While these six simple steps will help you launch your blog, it’s also equally important to remain consistent and find new ways to engage your audience. The most successful bloggers are dedicated and keep their readers in the heart of everything they write.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, go ahead, start your lifestyle blog, <a href=\"https://adelabelin.com/2020/04/16/how-to-drive-organic-traffic-and-grow-your-blog-in-2020/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">attract traffic</a> and grow your community of readers.</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>You’ve spent an entire week crafting that perfect press release. You put together a list of publications you want to pitch to, draft a pitch email, and hit ‘send’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A day passes, two days pass ..a week passes. Not one positive response. Nada.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Are press releases dead,” you wonder? No, they aren’t dead. They’ve just evolved and if you want to get your message across, you need to too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Press releases have come a long way since their inception. What used to be a text-heavy document, aimed for print media has now evolved to fit multiple channels of communications including websites, social media, blogs, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What’s more, editors get hundreds of press releases in a day &#8212; so, why should they read yours?</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/wZ2MLlfN2eRP2/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>To stand out, a press release needs to be creative enough to grab the attention of the journalist and get placed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>6 Tips to Revamp the Traditional Press Release</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you think your press releases are not getting the responses you hoped for, it probably is time to come out of the cave and give your press release strategy a facelift.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are six practical tips to rethink your press release approach and get covered.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Hook with an enticing headline</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Editors are busy people. They don’t have the time to read each and every press release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to grab their attention? Hook them with an enticing headline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A killer headline which is crisp, informative and evokes emotion is most likely to grab the attention of a journalist and compel them to read the press release. You can also use attention-grabbing data to <a href=\"https://writersperhour.com/blog/essay-hooks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">hook readers</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An ideal press release headline <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/best-headline-length/\">shouldn’t be more than 6 words</a> long and should include the most crucial information of the press release. So, identify the most important message and make sure you use it in the headline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to emphasize further, include a sub-heading right below the headline in italics to complement the headline.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A good practice while crafting headlines is to ask yourself if the headline you write will make you (as a reader) read that news if you come across it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can use a tool such as <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://coschedule.com/headline-analyzer\" target=\"_blank\">CoSchedule’s Headline Analyzer</a> to get inspiration.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Add value with quotes</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Many PR professionals treat adding quotes like a tick-box exercise. Adding quotes for the sake of it won’t get you anywhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, a press release carries more weightage when you include a quote from a spokesperson but a bland quote can do more harm than good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea of adding quotes is to add value and strike a connection with the audience. Use quotes to strengthen your press release rather than repeating what’s already written.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While drafting them, make sure they’re conversational and in line with the main communication. Make it inspirational, add insights, or emphasize a certain aspect through the quotes you add.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Incorporate statistical data</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You’re opening 50 stores in the next 5 years?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ve raised USD 1 million dollars through a fundraising activity?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your study indicates that 68% of B2B marketers consider <a href=\"https://aeroleads.com/blog/lead-generation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">lead generation</a> to be their biggest challenge?</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/kr1lvPzcAengQ/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, that’s the kind of reaction you’re likely to get with the use of data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Data is powerful. It makes your story newsworthy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, make your press releases worthy by using numbers, data, and relevant statistical information.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Be mindful of SEO practices</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Press releases were considered as a marketing practice to generate traffic for websites. Due to that, they were stuffed with keywords and backlinks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, owing to Google’s latest updates, you can no longer hope to do that and get ranked.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Search engines are now smart enough to detect and blacklist a press release stuffed with keywords and backlinks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While you should make your press release SEO-friendly by adding the target keywords in the headline and across the content, don’t forget that you’re writing for humans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an attempt to optimize your press release for search engines, you cannot compromise on the story and writing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Use original graphics and visuals</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As per a <a href=\"https://www.prdaily.com/report-journalists-are-ditching-the-press-release/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">study</a>, 49% of reporters said that they’d more likely pay attention to a press release if it contained an infographic, and 13% said they’d pay attention if a video was featured in a release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s not surprising.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With everything getting digital and the attention span of readers decreasing steadily, businesses are now focusing on short and crisp copies with a lot more visuals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With photo editing tools such as <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.canva.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Canva</a> and <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://piktochart.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Piktochart</a>, creating visuals is easier than ever. You can choose to make your press releases more attention-grabbing by using lots of visuals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, make sure you don’t use the run-of-the-mill stock photos. The idea is to use original graphics such as infographics, charts, screenshots, and videos among others.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>End with a powerful CTA</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Ending your press release on a high note is as important as starting it in the right note.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sum up your message at the end with a powerful call-to-action (CTA). Having a powerful CTA for your press release is important as it gives a direction to the audience on the next step.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Determine your goal for your press release before you draft one. Do you want more sales, subscribers, or traffic? Once you are clear on the purpose, it will be easier for you to draft a compelling CTA.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, include your contact information and the boilerplate content which is a brief note about your organization.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion: Are Press Releases Dead?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A press release is an important and critical part of business communication so use it judicially.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This mode of communication works best when announcing a win, breaking an important new announcement, there is a new product launch, you want to announce an upcoming event, sharing research done by the company, crisis management, or there is an important change in the organization that the public needs to know.&nbsp; Adhering to these tips will help you to draft press releases that stand out and <a href=\"https://adelabelin.com/2020/03/06/how-to-create-engaging-content-6-tips-to-captivate-your-readers/\">engage readers</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re struggling here, feel free to write to me and I can help you <a href=\"https://adelabelin.com/services/write-my-press-release/\">write a powerful press release</a> that tells a compelling story in line with the best SEO practices.&nbsp;</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>Every blogger or website owner is actively looking for ways to drive organic traffic to their blog or business website. Why? Because with more traffic comes increased sales opportunities, more leads and conversions, and eventually more revenue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike paid advertising, creating organic traffic is not easy to come by. According to<a href=\"https://ahrefs.com/blog/search-traffic-study/\"> a study on search traffic conducted by Ahrefs</a>, 90.63% of pages on the web do not receive organic traffic from Google.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/LJPfWhMCs9Rks/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>With the vast majority of pages on the web receiving no visitors from Google, how can you keep your blog in the remaining 9.36% ?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Driving organic traffic takes time, consistency, and diligence to put a working system in place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, what’s the secret sauce? This article will walk you through nine proven steps that every blogger can follow to create an insanely successful organic traffic pipeline.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may not enjoy so much success within a couple of weeks, but following these steps will diversify and strengthen your traffic sources in the long-term.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s dive straight in.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>9 Actionable Steps to Increase Organic Traffic to Your Blog</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/state-of-marketing?\" target=\"_blank\">Hubspot</a> reports that 61% of marketers say that increasing organic visibility is their highest priority when it comes to inbound marketing.Here are nine proven and easy-to-follow steps that every blogger can follow to increase their organic traffic.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. Optimize your blog for SEO</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Optimizing for <a href=\"https://en.rockcontent.com/blog/what-is-seo/\">SEO</a> involves increasing its search engine rankings and boosting visibility. It’s a diverse concept that involves both onsite and offsite optimization. Some technical SEO steps that you should follow to ensure your blog is performing well in the search engine include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Ensure target keywords feature throughout your web content.</li><li>Include keywords in your titles, meta descriptions, and headings.</li><li>Use high-quality images, audio, and video content</li><li>Use keyword-rich alt text for your images.</li><li>Ensure quick loading speed</li><li>Ensure your blog is mobile-friendly</li><li>Fix all broken links</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Using these SEO tips will give your blog a head start- it will be easy for Google bots to index and crawl your blog and eventually improve your rankings.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Do extensive keyword research to identify suitable topics</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Doing keyword research can help you identify phrases that can generate a considerable amount of traffic and social views.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The good thing is that the process doesn’t have to be painful or time-consuming. You can use tools such as <a href=\"https://ads.google.com/intl/en_ae/home/tools/keyword-planner/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Google’s Keyword Planner</a>, <a href=\"https://ahrefs.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Ahrefs</a>, or <a href=\"https://answerthepublic.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Answer The Public</a>, to discover how popular particular search phrases are in your niche.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is a good example using Ahrefs&#8217; Keyword Explorer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s consider a blogger whose area of interest is “content marketing”, which in this case serves as our seed keyword. To identify suitable topics around this topic, we use the keyword explorer to generate a list of relevant keywords.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"900\" height=\"484\" src=\"https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/example-using-ahrefs-keyword-explorer.gif\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-156\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Worth a mention is that ranking for long-tail keywords is far easier as compared to the common short keywords. They’re arguably the holy grail when it comes to getting to getting higher organic traffic and conversion values.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/03/17/what-is-a-good-conversion-rate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Wordstream</a>, long-tail keywords convert at 36%, almost 2.5 times more than the top ten landing pages whose conversion rate averages at 11.45%. Since long-tail keywords are highly focused, they can help you fuel your blog strategy and eventually, outperform the competition.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One great way of discovering keyword ideas and uncovering new opportunities is by checking the SERP results. For instance, if you’re writing a blog post targeting the long-tail keyword “how to hire a financial advisor”, you can perform a quick search for the topic on Google.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"685\" height=\"131\" src=\"https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/google-search-resultsexample.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-157\" srcset=\"https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/google-search-resultsexample.png 685w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/google-search-resultsexample-300x57.png 300w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/google-search-resultsexample-640x122.png 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 685px) 100vw, 685px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Upon searching, you will realize that the “people also ask” section (positioned just below the featured snippet), offers a set of questions related to your search query.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"548\" height=\"217\" src=\"https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/google-search-results-people-ask-example.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-158\" srcset=\"https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/google-search-results-people-ask-example.png 548w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/google-search-results-people-ask-example-300x119.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 548px) 100vw, 548px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>This section provides keyword ideas and topics that might catch the attention of your readers. Additionally, there’s a “related searches” section at the bottom of the search results, which is super helpful for content ideation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"542\" height=\"202\" src=\"https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/related-search-example-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-160\" srcset=\"https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/related-search-example-1.png 542w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/related-search-example-1-300x112.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 542px) 100vw, 542px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. Create high-quality content</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the best ways to increase organic traffic is by <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://adelabelin.com/2020/03/06/how-to-create-engaging-content-6-tips-to-captivate-your-readers/\" target=\"_blank\">creating engaging content</a>. It comes in handy when optimizing your posts for SEO and your readers as well. The perfect content for your blog should be:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Relevant to the target audience</li><li>Original and unique</li><li>Descriptive and informational</li><li>Thought-provoking or actionabe</li><li>Backed with high-quality visuals</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>While it is possible to ensure your content, whether long or short, has the attributes mentioned above, <a href=\"https://neilpatel.com/blog/why-you-need-to-create-evergreen-long-form-content-and-how-to-produce-it/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">long-form blog posts work best</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Longer posts are naturally more keyword rich and will rank better for long-tail keywords. Additionally, the in-depth nature of long posts is more satisfying to readers. For this reason, content that ticks the “long-form” box is more likely to attract readers, which in turn has a positive implication on your blog traffic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://backlinko.com/content-study\" target=\"_blank\">content study by Backlinko</a> shows that long-form content gets 77.2% more links than shorter articles below 1000 words.&nbsp; The study also reports that the ideal content for maximizing social shares is between 1000 and 2000 words.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>4. Publish content regularly</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you craft high-quality content, the next step should be focusing on <a href=\"https://adelabelin.com/2020/03/01/how-to-blog-consistently-and-never-run-out-of-content/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">consistency</a>. Bloggers who produce and publish great content on a regular basis are more likely to enjoy success.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A good approach to this would be coming up with a realistic publishing schedule that you can follow on a long-term basis. By updating your website with fresh and high-quality content, your chances of ranking on the search engines are much higher.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>5. Build an email list</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.oberlo.com/blog/email-marketing-statistics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Oberlo</a>, there are more than 3.7 billion email accounts worldwide.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A whopping over 269 billion emails are also sent every day. These mind-boggling figures are a clear indication of how emails, if used correctly, can be a great channel for generating organic traffic. While this sounds great, you ought to know that not every email list generates traffic results.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, start building your email list by placing an opt-in form. You can encourage readers to subscribe to your blog, a newsletter or even offer valuable gated content in the form of eBooks, reports, and PDFs among others.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having an email list is a great way to strike a long-lasting relationship with your readers and keep them coming back for more.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>6. Be active on social media</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Most bloggers use social media platforms to push out their content. While this is pretty easy, most do not know how to drive organic traffic from these platforms to their blog.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first step should be choosing the right social media platforms. You don’t have to be on every platform &#8211; what’s important is choosing the one that’s most frequented by your target audience.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Be active by putting out at a couple of posts or updates every day. The trick here is keeping your social followers engaged with valuable content. It is also important to add social sharing buttons on your blog so that visitors can share content on their favorite social platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another way of driving traffic is by getting involved in social media groups. There are groups for every niche on the web. Here, you will find an online community that is interested in what you blog about.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Always complement the work of other community members and share thoughtful insights regularly. Additionally, focus on making valuable contributions to conversations and share relevant links to your blog content.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>7. Guest posting</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Guest blogging is a traffic generation tactic where you create content for other blogs and websites. In return, your content will be visible to the website’s visitors and social followers. You also get some credit and a chance to link back to your blog. This is a proven way of generating more traffic, social shares, and quality backlinks that enhance your ranking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Worth a mention is that not every website out there is suitable for guest posting. You should start by researching top ranking websites and blogs with significant social influence.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.quicksprout.com/how-to-find-the-best-places-to-guest-blog/\" target=\"_blank\">identify suitable targets for your guest posts</a>, consider pitching to them. The key to a successful pitch is ensuring the choice of topic is in line with the website offerings. By showing how your post will add value to their blog, you have a greater chance of getting accepted.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>8. Participate in question and answer forums</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Q&amp;A forums are a great place for bloggers to expand their reach to relevant and interested audiences. Monitor ongoing conversations related to your niche and pitch in with some helpful information.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, if you blog about Python programming and someone asks a question on “How to get started with Python,” you could create some short custom content responding to the question. Within your answer, include a link to your blog so that the requester and other interested viewers can check through for more information.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"382\" src=\"https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/quora-answers-example-1024x382.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-162\" srcset=\"https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/quora-answers-example-1024x382.png 1024w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/quora-answers-example-300x112.png 300w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/quora-answers-example-768x286.png 768w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/quora-answers-example-640x239.png 640w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/quora-answers-example.png 1073w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>9. Partner with other bloggers</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As a blogger, you might have realized that there are plenty of non-competing blogs in your niche with the same target audience. A good traffic generation idea would be partnering with them to create collaborative content such as:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Expert roundups</li><li>Podcasts</li><li>Guest appearances</li><li>Feature interviews</li><li>Webinars</li><li>Collaborative newsletters</li><li>Challenges and contests</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Creative collaboration can be enormously productive. By working together, you cross-promote across each other’s audience base. This kind of networking gives you access to an entirely new, yet highly interested user base without compromising your partner’s traffic.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The above strategies are proven and powerful enough to take your blog traffic a notch higher.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Growth and results are not realized overnight, but through <a href=\"https://adelabelin.com/2020/04/09/6-tips-to-stay-motivated-as-a-new-blogger-and-not-give-up-on-your-blog/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">motivation</a> and consistency in everything you do. Stick to these strategies, and you will eventually expand your reach, attract more readers, and drive traffic to your blog.</p>\n",

Build a habit</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The key to staying motivated to write is building a habit out of it. Why not create some writing rituals to develop a consistent writing habit?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dedicate certain hours of the day to just brainstorming and writing blog content. Think of places where you can concentrate and write better. You can also head to a cafe or create a home office. When you make this a ritual, you’ll notice you’ll be writing better and more frequently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure you pencil this in your calendar and set daily reminders so you don’t miss out on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Set actionable goals</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To succeed as a blogger, you must set realistic and actionable goals.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Start with setting daily goals before you move towards larger goals. For example, your daily goal can be to write one blog post and planning and researching for the next two topics.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your broader goal can be what one thing you want to do for your blog to take it to the next level? It can be sharing your posts on social media, getting a mentor to review your work, or optimizing your blog for SEO. Set actionable goals, deliver, and be accountable for it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s important to remember that blogging is a slow and steady process. So, don’t get demotivated when you don’t see the number of readers flowing in. Just stay committed to growing your blog and you’ll see your efforts paying off soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. Network, Network, Network</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>No matter which profession you are in, networking always helps. This holds true for bloggers too. Blogging is a lonely profession and you need to interact with other bloggers for many reasons.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are a new blogger you can learn a lot from fellow bloggers through networking.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many online bloggers’ forums where you can become a member, share your work, receive honest reviews, and learn from others. There are plenty of online forums, Facebook and LinkedIn groups for bloggers that you can join and participate in.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Networking also comes into good use when you’re looking to create collaborative content in partnership with other bloggers and grow your readership in the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>4. Celebrate small wins</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many instances when we’re too busy whining about what’s gone wrong rather than acknowledging what’s gone right. So, celebrate the small wins.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They will help you stay motivated especially during your initial phase of blogging. You might not be able to make monetary gain from your first few posts, but that shouldn&#8217;t stop you from marching forward.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Celebrate when you achieve your blogging milestones. For example, your first blog comment, the first note of appreciation, your first blog subscriber, and so on. Having a blogging journal is also a great idea to note down all your blogging milestones.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>5. Find a mentor or a blogging buddy</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Having a mentor or a blogging buddy is helpful when you are just starting out as a blogger.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reach out to seasoned bloggers who’ve been in the game longer than you and seek help. Blogging groups on social media platforms are the best place to find these mentors. A mentor can guide you, help you identify your challenges and show you how to overcome them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having a blogging buddy is also a good idea. A blogging buddy can be your friend or a peer who started his/her blogging journey with you. Since both of you are sailing in the same boat, it is easy to exchange ideas, discuss challenges, and overcome them together. Having a blogging buddy can help you stay focused and motivated.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>6. Take a break</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of the day, blogging is a creative process. <a href=\"https://writersperhour.com/blog/stress-management-tips-for-students\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Don&#8217;t stress</a> yourself if your ideas are not flowing and if you feel stuck.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There will be times when you feel like you’ve hit a rock. At such times, instead of being too hard on yourself, just take a break and focus on your <a href=\"https://ied.eu/project-updates/the-role-of-a-manager-in-the-well-being-of-the-employees/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">well-being</a>. Give your time to relax and unwind before you can come back to it with a fresher headspace and (hopefully) ideas you can bring to fruition.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Blogging requires immense patience, determination, and creativity. It might seem like a cakewalk but it really isn’t.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to grow your blog, you need to stay committed to <a href=\"https://adelabelin.com/2020/03/01/how-to-blog-consistently-and-never-run-out-of-content/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">creating engaging content</a> on a consistent basis. It’s a good idea to develop an editorial calendar so you can plan your content well in advance and work towards publishing articles.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you’re consistent, motivated and charged up, you will start seeing the results. So, follow these six tips and regain your motivation to kickstart your blogging journey.&nbsp;</p>\n",

With the rise of new mediums and content formats, one might wonder if blogs are still relevant today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The answer is yes, more than ever.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/5wFkqt6A8R4qAqGIFQ/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re tempted to do away with the good ol’ blog, stop right there. Here are some interesting <a href=\"https://optinmonster.com/blogging-statistics/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"blogging statistics (opens in a new tab)\">blogging statistics</a> that will make you think otherwise.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Companies who blog get 97% more links to their websites.</li><li>Businesses that blog experience twice as much email traffic as businesses who don’t</li><li>Marketers who prioritize blogging are 13x more likely to have a positive ROI on their efforts</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The above-mentioned data just reaffirms that blogs are an important content marketing tool that every business should adopt and work towards with all seriousness.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>6 Compelling Reasons to Start a Blog (and Reap the Benefits)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Still not convinced? Here are six solid reasons to start a blog.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. Drives traffic</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Have a website? Drive traffic. Isn’t that what all of us are aiming for anyway?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Search engines like websites that are rich in content and updated frequently and consistently. Having fresh content up regularly sends out the message to the search engines that your site is active.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blogging serves that purpose. Every time you add fresh, <a href=\"https://adelabelin.com/2020/03/06/how-to-create-engaging-content-6-tips-to-captivate-your-readers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"engaging content (opens in a new tab)\">engaging content</a> as a blog post, search engines index your page and help visitors find your website. The more optimized it is for SEO, the better it ranks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also share your blog content on social media and email marketing campaigns to attract readers. All these efforts will eventually help you to drive traffic to your website.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea is to share valuable content that will turn website visitors into loyal readers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Improves conversions</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s no longer easy to convert website visitors into customers. However, with a blog and steady traffic, you have the opportunity to generate interest in potential customers by educating them about your product or services and convert them into leads or customers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, you can write an informational blog post and end it with a strong call-to-action, directing them to your services page.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alternatively, you can also seed <a href=\"https://aeroleads.com/blog/lead-magnet-grow-email-list/\">lead magnets</a> (eg. eBooks, white papers, guides, checklists, etc.) and have website visitors share their email address in exchange for the piece of content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This will help you generate leads and nurture them further to take them down the sales funnel.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. Establishes authority</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s face it &#8211; everyone online is looking for a solution to a pain point or challenge they’re facing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blogs are a powerful tool that helps to build trust among your customers by catering to their needs, answering questions, addressing their challenges and sharing useful tips.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By writing insightful content, you get the opportunity to project yourself as an expert. This goes a long way in strengthening your personal brand and establishing your credibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/l3V0q1JDkTaUzpgm4/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The key is to understand your target audience, know what they want and create content that accurately meets their needs. Write on topics that your audience wants to hear about and give them a reason to trust you and read your blog.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>4. Networking</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Blogging is a networking tool and we know how important networking is in today’s world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consistent blogging helps you reach more people, strengthen your personal brand and make connections with influencers and thought leaders in your niche.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s not all, being an active blogger also means commenting on fellow bloggers’ posts and sharing their content with your community of readers. This is an effective way to make connections and grow your blog in the process.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also create expert roundup posts and contribute guest posts to other websites that speak a similar audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>5. Connect with the audience</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Another reason to start a blog is to connect with your target audience and show them you care.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Connecting with your audience essentially means that you’re able to assess their intent and create content that they can relate to. It’s important to use your blog as a two-way communication tool &#8211; ask them questions, and engage with them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you keep your readers at the heart of everything you write, you’re able to evoke emotions and create posts that truly deliver value.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>6. Creates link building opportunities</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Having a strong link building strategy is an effective way to drive traffic. When you have a blog, you have more opportunities to build links to your website which results in better search engine rankings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether it’s earning backlinks through outreach and guest posting or inserting internal links within your website &#8211; blogging lets you build links and drive qualitative and relevant traffic back to your website.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Blogs form the foundation of a strong content marketing strategy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, just having a blog is not enough. It’s important to plan your content well, write valuable posts, <a href=\"https://adelabelin.com/2020/03/01/how-to-blog-consistently-and-never-run-out-of-content/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"publish consistently (opens in a new tab)\">publish consistently</a> and spend time engaging with other bloggers too.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best blogs are those that readers can derive value from which helps attract new visitors, and increases chances of conversions. So, what are you waiting for? It’s time to get blogging.</p>\n",

Let’s take a moment to understand what engaging content is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A simple search on Google throws back hundreds and thousands of search results, few relevant to you. You probably click on some of them and start skimming through but do you actually read all of them? Probably not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You read only those that get your attention and <strong>engage</strong> you through compelling storytelling, useful information, easy-to-comprehend language, and relevant visuals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, that’s a lot of pressure on a content writer.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>6 Pro Tips to Create Engaging Content and Hook your Readers</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s tough to churn out engaging content but that is what is going to set you apart from fellow writers. So, if you want to attract and retain readers, you have to go the extra mile and make your blogs and other content pieces engaging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve put together six tried and tested tips to help you create engaging content that will captivate your audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. Grab attention with a compelling headline</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Headlines are the first thing a reader reads. Whether he will read and spend time on your content or not largely depends on your headline.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Did you know that <a href=\"https://copyblogger.com/magnetic-headlines/\">80% of readers never make it past the headline</a>?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The headline you craft sets the expectations of the reader and gives a gist on what to expect from the blog.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, how do you create a compelling one? By offering something unique to the readers, evoke emotions or creating a sense of urgency. You can include an action word, an interesting number, powerful adjectives or even a negative word to evoke their interest.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also use a tool such as <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/headline-analyzer\">CoSchedule’s Headline Analyzer</a> to generate interesting headlines.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Share Anecdotes</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Using anecdotes in writing is a great way to create engaging content. Anecdotes are short stories or personal experiences to help you establish your point and connect with your audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can use anecdotes, in the beginning, to <a href=\"https://writersperhour.com/blog/essay-hooks\">hook readers</a> or set the context for the topic or in the middle, to establish a point with an example.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anecdotes are immensely helpful in persuasive writing. You connect with your audience instantly when you share a story. While using anecdotes, make sure they’re relevant to your writing and add value to your content piece.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. Focus on readability</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Readability refers to the ability of the reader to read and understand your content. It plays an important role in creating engaging content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How you ask? Everyone’s intellect is not the same so you need to write such that is easy to read and understand for everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can use tools such as <a href=\"http://grammarly.com/\">Grammarly</a> to check the readability of your content. The key is to write short sentences, break down your thoughts into short paragraphs, and write in an active voice as much as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You should also use subheadings, bullet points, and lists to create make your content easy to scan, read and understand.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>4. Write for human and search engines</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In the race to be ranked well on search engines, what most content writers fail to understand is that one needs to write for humans <em>first</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have to cater to your readers’ needs and sensibilities. Stuffing articles with keywords will just make it sound robotic and there’s no way it can hold a reader’s attention.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, think about what your readers want first &#8211; write to answer their queries and solve their problems while creating a value-driven post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you’re done <a href=\"https://adelabelin.com/2020/03/01/how-to-blog-consistently-and-never-run-out-of-content/\">brainstorming ideas</a>, make sure you write in a conversational manner &#8211; just the way you speak.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, there’s no denying that your blog needs to be optimized for SEO for your readers to find it. Follow these five key points create SEO-centric content:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Include a mix of short and long-tail keywords across the content. Use tools such as <a href=\"https://ahrefs.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Ahrefs (opens in a new tab)\">Ahrefs</a> to do keyword research</li><li>Write a compelling headline and meta-description, with the target keywords</li><li>Insert external and internal links in your content</li><li>Optimize the page URL and images to include the target keyword</li><li>Ensure your blog is mobile-friendly and loads fast</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>5. Support with data and facts</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A huge part of writing valuable and insightful posts is ensuring you support your claims and points with enough data, facts, and research from trustworthy sources. Doing this adds credibility to your content.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>6. Use Enticing Visuals</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/visual-content-marketing-infographic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Hubspot (opens in a new tab)\">Hubspot</a>, adding visual content in your blog can help you generate up to 94% more views.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Visuals not only engage the audience but is also a welcome change to break the monotony of text. You can use visuals in the form of static images, GIFs, videos, and infographics.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, if there’s something you can say better or emphasized upon with visuals, it’s a good idea to include them strategically in your content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, do make sure you source visuals from copyright-free image websites such as <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Unsplash (opens in a new tab)\">Unsplash</a> and <a href=\"http://www.pexels.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Pexels (opens in a new tab)\">Pexels</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also use tools such as <a href=\"https://piktochart.com/\">Piktochart</a>, <a href=\"http://www.venngage.com\">Venngage</a>, and <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Canva (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"http://www.canva.com\" target=\"_blank\">Canva</a> to create your own infographics and banners in minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"724\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Simple-Charcoal-and-White-Writer-Checklist-724x1024.png\" alt=\"Simple Charcoal and White Writer Checklist\" class=\"wp-image-136\" srcset=\"https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Simple-Charcoal-and-White-Writer-Checklist-724x1024.png 724w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Simple-Charcoal-and-White-Writer-Checklist-212x300.png 212w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Simple-Charcoal-and-White-Writer-Checklist-768x1086.png 768w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Simple-Charcoal-and-White-Writer-Checklist-1086x1536.png 1086w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Simple-Charcoal-and-White-Writer-Checklist-640x905.png 640w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Simple-Charcoal-and-White-Writer-Checklist.png 1414w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 724px) 100vw, 724px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating engaging content is an art and it definitely needs a lot of practice.

If yes, it’s time to change your approach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You need to keep your eyes open and be updated on the latest trends and happenings in your niche. They can be the biggest source of inspiration for your blog posts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s say you blog about social media and you read about the rise of TikTok. How about writing a post on it and sharing your perspective too? That way, you jump onto the bandwagon early and deliver topical blog posts your readers will enjoy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, the question is &#8211; how do you stay updated? Here’s how.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Follow influencers in your industry on Twitter and LinkedIn</li><li>Join LinkedIn and Facebook Groups</li><li>Set up Google Alerts for keywords and topics related to your niche</li><li>Subscribe to relevant blogs </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Spy on your Competitors</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When you’re blogging, it’s always a good idea to keep an eye on your competitors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Start with making a list of competitors you want to track. You can use a tool such as <a href=\"https://buzzsumo.com/use-cases/competitor-intelligence/\">BuzzSumo </a>to understand how their content is performing and take special note of the posts that get a lot of shares.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"499\" src=\"https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/BuzzSumo-workflow-1024x499.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-121\" srcset=\"https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/BuzzSumo-workflow-1024x499.png 1024w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/BuzzSumo-workflow-300x146.png 300w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/BuzzSumo-workflow-768x374.png 768w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/BuzzSumo-workflow-640x312.png 640w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/BuzzSumo-workflow.png 1349w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another way to make this work for you is by evaluating gaps in your competitor’s content &#8211; is there something they missed out on? Can you write a more comprehensive post on the same topic? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s also a good idea to check the comments section on their posts to see if someone’s asking a specific question you can address in your blog post.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Browse Forums</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Not many realize but forums such as Quora, Reddit, and even Facebook and LinkedIn groups can be a huge source of inspiration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They give you an insight into the burning questions and challenges your potential readers are facing. You can take cues from there and create blog posts, addressing those pain points and challenges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s say you’re writing a post on ‘side hustle’. All you have to do is type the keywords ‘side hustle’ on Quora and you’ll be met with a series of questions people are asking. Pick one that’s got a lot of engagement and create a detailed blog post on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"887\" height=\"847\" src=\"https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/quora-search-results.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-123\" srcset=\"https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/quora-search-results.png 887w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/quora-search-results-300x286.png 300w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/quora-search-results-768x733.png 768w, https://adelabelin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/quora-search-results-640x611.png 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 887px) 100vw, 887px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>‘Listen’ to your Readers</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, it’s about creating content that your readers would be interested in. So, why not ask them what they want to read about?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Send them a survey and ask them what kind of posts would they like to see. Make sure the survey form is short and easy to fill &#8211; that’s the most effective way to ensure maximum responses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s advisable to send close-ended questions so it’s easier to analyze trends in the responses.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can create an online survey for free in minutes using tools such as <a href=\"https://www.google.com/forms/about/\">Google Forms</a> and <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/\">Survey Monkey</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Repurpose Past Content</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of us are so focussed on creating new content that we don’t realize that you can still create fresh content by repurposing past blog posts. By doing this, you not only save time but also find avenues to reach new readers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some ways you can repurpose your past content:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Break down your blog posts into <a href=\"https://instasize.com/blog/free-photo-editing-software-instasize\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">social media content</a></li><li>Convert blog posts into videos</li><li>Create pillar page content with posts that fall under the same umbrella topic</li><li>Transform an old post into an infographic<br></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from repurposing past content, you should also consider updating old posts. HubSpot did a study and found that <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/historical-blog-seo-conversion-optimization\">76% of their monthly blog views came from &#8220;old&#8221; posts</a>, making it important to optimize past content to make it more accurate, fresh and have it rank better.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Maintain an Editorial Calendar</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“What has maintaining an editorial calendar got to do with not running out of content?”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, having an editorial calendar for your blog lets you plan content in advance. You’re able to get a bird’s eye view of the kind/category/format of posts you’re posting and what you can do to improve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Secondly, an editorial calendar helps you become more consistent in terms of blogging. When you plan out the month’s content, you give yourself a goal and work towards that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of the frequency of posting, what’s important is committing to the number of blog posts you want to publish and abide by it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some tools you can use to plan your blog content are <a href=\"http://trello.com/\">Trello</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets\">Google Sheets</a>, or <a href=\"https://todoist.com/\">ToDoist</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, it’s tough to churn out content on a regular basis but with these six smart tactics in mind, there’s no stopping you from transforming into an idea machine and never running out of content that your readers will enjoy. </p>\n",
